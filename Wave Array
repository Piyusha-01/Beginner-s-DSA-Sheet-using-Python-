Wave Array
Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place). In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....
If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.
Note: The given array is sorted in ascending order, and you don't need to return anything to change the original array.
Examples:
Input: n = 5, arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 2 1 4 3 5
Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in the waveform are 2 1 4 3 5.
Input: n = 6, arr[] = {2,4,7,8,9,10}
Output: 4 2 8 7 10 9
Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in the waveform are 4 2 8 7 10 9.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤107

            if i+1 < n and arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
                arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
