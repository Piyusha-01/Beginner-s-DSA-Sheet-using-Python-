Given two integer variables a and b, and a boolean variable flag. The task is to check the status and return accordingly.
Return True for the following cases:

Either a or b (not both) is non-negative and the flag is false.
Both a and b are negative and the flag is true.
Otherwise, return false.


solution:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
def check_status(a, b, flag):
    if flag:
        # Check if both a and b are negative
        if a < 0 and b < 0:
            return True
    else:
        # Check if either a or b is non-negative, but not both
        if (a >= 0 and b < 0) or (a < 0 and b >= 0):
            return True
        return False
